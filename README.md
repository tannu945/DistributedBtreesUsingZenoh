> Initially, I gave event "prepare_tip_to_pickup" and the output for that response is rejected, which is the required output. After that I gave "tip_available", the event was accepted. The next event was "prepare_tip_to_pickup", this time it accepted the event. Next I gave a random event from the btree which was rejected.
